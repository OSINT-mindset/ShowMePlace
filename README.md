# ExtractSatelliteImagesFromCSV
This repo shows you how to extract satellite images using a CSV file that contains coordinates (latitude and longitude)

Note: This was run in PyCharm on a Windows environment. It works perfectly on Ubuntu too.

# Instructions
1. Create a mapbox account here: www.mapbox.com. 
2. Once logged in, scroll down to Default Public Token. Copy it! You will need it in the ExtractSatelliteImages.py file
3. Make sure you have downloaded and installed GeckoDriver in your computer. You can get it here: https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases
4. Store the GeckoDriver.exe file in your root folder
5. Run the ExtractSatelliteImages.py file. More explanations are in the comments
